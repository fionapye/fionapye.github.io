# Background
The inspiration for this website came from working with SQL and realising that particular function combinations and syntax were useful in lots of different places. Initially I tried to recall where they were from, but this quickly became unsustainable.

I realised that the most efficient way was to store them somewhere central and accessible, along with nice demos of their functionality.
Since I learnt a lot from the online community I wanted to give something back, and so this blog came into being!

I mainly work with Microsoft SQL Server using Transact-SQL (T-SQL) so the examples on here (at least for now) are primarily for this, although I am sure a lot of the logic carries between versions.

## Tags
The SQL resources are tagged with the version of SQL they were developed in. See the Key below.

[Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-ver15) → for SQL Server they built it! Less user friendly, but right into the technical detail. <br>
